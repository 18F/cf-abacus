===

Small utility that computes real time function call performance and reliability metrics

Usage

This module provides a way to collect function call performance and reliability
metrics and compute real time stats on these metrics. The stats are computed
using rolling windows of call successes, failures, timeouts, circuit breaker
rejections and latencies.
